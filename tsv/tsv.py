# This module consists of some functions useful for processing .tsv (tab-separated value) files.
# The tsvRead function imports all data from a .tsv file into a Python list of lists of strings.
# The data consists of a list of rows. Each row is a list of field values.
# Strips leading and trailing spaces from field values.
# This module also has a tsvWrite function that writes a list of list of strings to a specified file.
# The list2Dict function converts a list to a Python dictionary mapping.
# make_key() generates keys used in the dictionary.

# The entire file is returned as a list of lists of strings (rows).
